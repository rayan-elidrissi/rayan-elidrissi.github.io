<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    This research presents a joint probabilistic optimization framework for cache placement in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The proposed approach aims to maximize data availability and minimize latency by intelligently deciding which content should be cached and in which nodes, taking into account the stochastic nature of IoT traffic and device connectivity. Through this framework, the study contributes strategies that improve network efficiency, reduce redundant transmissions, and enhance user experience in resource-constrained IoT environments. Future work may extend these ideas for larger scalability and address dynamic network topologies.
