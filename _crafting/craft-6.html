### Scientific contribution
- Implements periodicity detection circuits with clear oracle design and connects them to a broader QML landscape, outlining hybrid optimization strategies and complexity considerations.

### STAR
- **Situation**: Period finding and QML promise speedups but are often presented abstractly.
- **Task**: Produce didactic, executable artifacts that clarify assumptions and performance limits.
- **Action**: Built Qiskit notebooks for oracle construction and inverse QFT; authored a report surveying optimization methods and proposing a hybrid approach.
- **Result**: Reproducible circuits and visualizations used to teach periodicity concepts; a concise research agenda for smallâ€‘scale hybrid QML experiments.
