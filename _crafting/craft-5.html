### Scientific contribution
- Couples mechanistic vector models with data‑driven parameter estimation to produce calibrated risk maps; evaluates uncertainty and sensitivity to environmental covariates.

### STAR
- **Situation**: Public health agencies need localized, timely risk estimates but data are sparse/noisy.
- **Task**: Build interpretable models to forecast vector abundance and epidemic risk.
- **Action**: Implemented SEI‑type compartments and agent simulations; fit parameters via Bayesian inference/optimization; validated on incidence and entomological records.
- **Result**: Generated weekly risk maps with calibrated uncertainty; identified drivers (temperature, rainfall) and delivered a reproducible analysis pipeline.
