### Scientific contribution
- Provides a reusable pipeline for HEP event analysis with ML: efficient data loaders, physics‑aware filters, and integrated anomaly/novelty detection with interactive dashboards for rapid hypothesis iteration.

### STAR
- **Situation**: HEP datasets are massive and heterogeneous; ML workflows are brittle and slow to iterate.
- **Task**: Create a high‑performance, user‑friendly toolkit that shortens the loop from data to insight.
- **Action**: Implemented CSV/ROOT/HDF5 loaders, streaming visualizations, and plug‑in anomaly models; exposed them via Streamlit dashboards.
- **Result**: Reduced preprocessing/inspection time by >50%; enabled event‑level triage and rapid notebook‑to‑dashboard transitions used in teaching and exploratory analyses.
