### Scientific contribution
- Integrates coverage control and adaptive task allocation with thermal/multispectral detection; proposes metrics for time‑to‑detection and area‑under‑surveillance under wind/topography disturbances.

### STAR
- **Situation**: Satellite latency and resolution hinder early wildfire response.
- **Task**: Prototype swarm behaviors and perception stack for rapid detection and persistent tracking.
- **Action**: Built multi‑UAV simulator, implemented frontier‑based patrolling with consensus re‑tasking, trained lightweight detectors, and added a web dashboard for incident ops.
- **Result**: Cut simulated time‑to‑first‑detection by ~40% vs. baselines and maintained continuous boundary updates; documented deployment checklists for field trials.
