🔹 **Research-Driven Systems & Infrastructure**  
*Building human-centric, data-aligned systems across robotics, infrastructure, and decentralized technologies.*

**Zero-Trust Data Infrastructure for Web3**  
🥇 Sui Foundation Hackathon  
Built **SIRIUS**, a Git-like, zero-trust data layer that verifies and versions sensitive data before writing on-chain.  
Enabled verifiable history, controlled updates, and auditability for sensitive datasets.  

**Human-in-the-Loop Robotics**  
🥉 AMD × Hugging Face Open Robotics Hackathon, STATION F  
Developed an assistive robotic system that observes human tasks (assembly, surgery, maintenance), predicts the next required tool, and delivers it just-in-time.  
Focused on robustness under distribution shift by separating **intent (VLMs)** from **execution (imitation-learned skills)**: scaling better, generalizing further, and failing safer than end-to-end VLA policies.

**AI Decision Systems for Healthcare & Climate**  
Designed AI tools for decision support under uncertainty, not full automation.  
- Clinical workflow design (Google Healthcare & Life Sciences Hackathon)  
- Energy-aware datacenter placement (Doctolib AI Action Summit)

🔹 **Learning Ecosystems & Community Leadership**  
*Designing environments where people, constraints, and expertise collide to accelerate learning and execution.*

**Fellow, Unaite**  
Selected as a fellow in a national ecosystem uniting the top 7 French universities.  
Mission: connect top students, researchers, and entrepreneurs through curated events, deep technical exchanges, and long-term collaboration.

**AI & Research Lead, DeVinci Blockchain**  
Mentored 100+ students through workshops and applied research projects.  
Designed the AI curriculum and facilitated exchanges with academic labs in decentralization research.

**Organizer & Jury, IBM × De Vinci Hackathon**  
Co-designed a 48-hour sprint with IBM researchers and solution architects.  
200+ participants tackling real-world industry problems under production constraints.

**Co-Organizer, Shipping Coffee**  
Weekly build sessions where students and engineers prototype and ship complete systems in one evening.  
Emphasis on fast feedback, execution, and learning in public.
