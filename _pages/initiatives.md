*Building human-centric, data-aligned systems across robotics, infrastructure, and decentralized technologies.*

---

## 1. Research-Driven & Infrastructure

I design and prototype systems where **data integrity, distribution shift, and human intervention** are first-order constraints, not afterthoughts.

---

### Zero-Trust Data Infrastructure for Web3  
**🥇 Sui Foundation Hackathon**

Built **SIRIUS**, a Git-like, zero-trust data layer that verifies and versions sensitive data *before* it is written on-chain.

- Reframed blockchain reliability as a **data provenance problem**, not a consensus one  
- Enables verifiable history, controlled updates, and auditability for sensitive datasets  
- Built on Seal, Walrus, Nautilus, and Sui

### Human-in-the-Loop Robotics  
**🥉 AMD × Hugging Face Open Robotics Hackathon, STATION F**

Built an assistive robotic system that:
- observes human tasks (assembly, surgery, maintenance),
- predicts the next required tool,
- delivers it just-in-time.

Focus: End-to-end VLA policies collapse under small distribution shifts & Separating **intent (VLMs)** from **execution (imitation-learned skills)** scales better, generalizes further, and fails safer.

---

### AI Decision Systems for Healthcare & Climate

Built AI tools for:
- clinical workflow optimization (Google Healthcare & Life Sciences Hackathon)
- energy-aware datacenter placement (Doctolib AI Action Summit)

Focus: **decision support under uncertainty**, not full automation.

---

## 2. Bring People to Learn Together

I design events as **learning ecosystems**. Peers, experts, and constraints meet and exchange to accelerate understanding and execution.

---

### Fellow, Unaite

Selected as a fellow in a national ecosystem uniting the top 7 French universities.
- Mission: connect top students, researchers, and entrepreneurs  
- Format: curated events, deep technical exchanges, long-term collaboration

---

### AI & Research Lead, DeVinci Blockchain

- Mentored **100+ students** through workshops and applied research projects  
- Designed the AI curriculum  
- Facilitated exchanges between students and academic labs in decentralization research

---

### Organizer & Jury, IBM × De Vinci Hackathon

- Co-designed a 48-hour sprint with IBM researchers and solution architects  
- 200+ participants  
- Focus on real-world industry issues

---

### Co-Organizer, Shipping Coffee

Weekly build sessions where students and engineers:
- prototype and ship complete systems in one evening  
- receive fast feedback  
- learn in public

---

## 3. Throughline: Across research, infrastructure, robotics, and education

- Humans stay in the loop  
- Data is a first-class system component  
- Failure modes matter more than best-case performance  
- Learning scales through well-designed constraints
