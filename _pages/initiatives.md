*Building human-centric, data-aligned systems across robotics, infrastructure, and decentralized technologies.*

---

## 🔹 Research-Driven System Building

I design and prototype AI systems where **data integrity, distribution shift, and human intervention** are first-order constraints.

**Zero-Trust Data Infrastructure for Web3 (🥇 1st Place — Sui Foundation Hackathon)**  
Built **SIRIUS**, a Git-like, zero-trust data layer that verifies and versions sensitive data *before* it is written on-chain.  
Reframed blockchain reliability as a **data provenance problem**, not a consensus one.  
Built on Seal, Walrus, Nautilus, and Sui.

**Human-in-the-Loop Robotics (🥉 AMD × Hugging Face Open Robotics Hackathon — STATION F)**  
Built an assistive robotic system that observes human tasks (e.g. assembly, surgery), predicts the next required tool, and delivers it just-in-time.  
Key insight: end-to-end VLA policies collapse under small distribution shifts; separating **intent (VLMs)** from **execution (imitation-learned skills)** scales better and fails safer.

**AI Decision Systems for Healthcare & Climate**  
Built AI tools for clinical workflow optimization (Google Healthcare & Life Sciences Hackathon) and energy-aware datacenter placement (Doctolib AI Action Summit).  
Focused on decision support under uncertainty, not automation.

## 🔹 Bring People to Learn Together

I design **learning environments as systems**: where peers, experts, and constraints accelerate understanding.

**Fellow — Unaite**  
Selected as a fellow within a national ecosystem uniting top 7 French universities.  
Mission: connect the very best students, researchers, and entrepreneurs through curated events.

**AI & Research Lead — DeVinci Blockchain**  
Mentored 100+ students through workshops and applied research projects.  
Structured the AI curriculum and facilitated exchanges between students and labs in decentralization research.

**Organizer & Jury — IBM × De Vinci Hackathon**  
Designed a 48-hour sprint in collaboration with IBM researchers & solution architects for 200 attendees.

**Co-Organizer — Shipping Coffee**  
Weekly build sessions where students and engineers prototype and ship complete systems in one evening.  
Bias toward execution, fast feedback, and public learning.
