I’m a **research intern at Mines Paris - PSL University**, within the Center for Robotics, and an M. Eng student in Data Science & AI at ESILV Paris.

My background is in optimization and computer vision, currently expanding into *vision-language-action* models to investigate how we can integrate **perception**, **reasoning**, and **actions** to design systems that assist and collaborate with humans across diverse domains, from robotics to data-driven modeling.
I’m particularly interested in:

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: developing models that augment human creativity, expertise, and situational awareness.
- **Optimization**: designing and implementing mathematical and algorithmic strategies to improve decision-making and resource allocation in complex systems.
- **Multimodal & Embodied Intelligence**: integrating vision, language, and structured data with purposeful action by aligning perception and representation for adaptive, interactive interactions.


My Vision
------
My work focuses on **extending human capability**, designing systems that become natural extensions of our minds and hands.
I aim to develop intelligent systems that collaborate with us: preserving what makes us creative and curious while helping us discover what’s next.
