I’m an **affiliated researcher at Mines Paris - PSL University**, within the Center for Robotics, and an M. Eng student in Data Science & AI at ESILV Paris.

My background is in optimization (e.g., energy supply, IoT networks, GPU computing) and computer vision (e.g., segmentation, scene understanding).
Currently, I am expanding my focus to vision-language-action models, exploring how to integrate perception, reasoning, and action. My goal is to design systems that assist and collaborate with humans across domains, from robotics to data-driven modeling.

I’m particularly interested in:
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Developing models that augment human creativity, expertise, and situational awareness.
- **Optimization**: Designing and implementing mathematical and algorithmic strategies to improve decision-making and resource allocation in complex systems.
- **Multimodal & Embodied Intelligence**: Integrating vision, language, and structured data with purposeful action by aligning perception and representation for adaptive, interactive interactions.


My Vision
------
My work focuses on **extending human capability**, designing systems that become natural extensions of our minds and hands.
I aim to develop intelligent systems that collaborate with us: preserving what makes us creative and curious while helping us discover **what’s next**.
