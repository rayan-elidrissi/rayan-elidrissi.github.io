I’m a **research intern at Mines Paris - PSL University**, at the **Center for Robotics**. Primarily, my background is in computer vision, now working into <span className="text-foreground">vision‑language action models</span> that capture and interpret **human gestures, tools, and know-how**.

My research explores how we can bridge **perception, language, and action** to enable systems that efficiently collaborate with humans. I’m particularly focused on:

- **Embodied Intelligence**, enabling machines to perceive and act meaningfully in the physical world.  
- **Adaptive Interfaces**, designing systems that learn from and evolve with human behavior.  
- **Cognitive Augmentation**, extending human capability through intelligent, context-aware tools.  
- **Human–AI Collaboration**, developing models that support creativity, learning, and expertise transfer.


My Vision
------
My work is about **amplifying human skills**, to make our tools extensions of our mind and hands.
A kind of intelligence that helps us preserve what makes us unique, and pushes us to imagine what’s next.
