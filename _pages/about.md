I’m a **research intern at Mines Paris - PSL University**, within the Center for Robotics, and an M. Eng student in Data Science & AI at ESILV Paris.

My background is in optimization and computer vision, currently expanding into vision-language-action to investigate how we can integrate **perception**, **reasoning**, and **actions** to design systems that assist and collaborate with humans across diverse domains, from robotics to data-driven modeling.
I’m particularly interested in:

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: developing models that augment human creativity, expertise, and situational awareness.
- **Optimization**: designing and implementing mathematical and algorithmic strategies to improve decision-making and resource allocation in complex, real-world systems.
- **Multimodal & Embodied Intelligence**: integrating vision, language, and structured data with purposeful action by aligning perception and representation for adaptive, interactive interactions.


My Vision
------
My work is about **extending human capability**, to make our tools extensions of our mind and hands.
A kind of intelligence that helps us preserve what makes us unique, and pushes us to **imagine what’s next**.
